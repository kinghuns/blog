  <h1>About Hugo Paged</h1>

  <p>I immediately loved the design of <a href="https://pagedjs.org">the paged.js website</a> when I first saw it a couple of years ago.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I have published a few books before, so the crop marks on the website caught my attention first, which gave me a familiar feel of printed books. The second thing that I appreciated was the rotated floral heart bullet behind the title of each page, i.e.,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I wrote a Hugo theme that mimics the style of the paged.js website. I tried not to look at its HTML/CSS source code, but I had to read the source to figure out:</p>
<ol>
<li>How the crop marks were made with CSS (a very clever trick that I&rsquo;d never thought of);</li>
<li>What the floral heart symbol really was (I&rsquo;d never know this dingbat);</li>
<li>The fonts (<a href="https://github.com/theleagueof/linden-hill">Linden Hill</a> and <a href="https://github.com/indestructible-type/Jost">Jost</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of HTML and CSS code was written from scratch (well, not really&mdash;from <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">the Hugo XMin theme</a>). The code is fairly lightweight and hopefully easy for users to understand, tweak, or adapt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank paged.js developers for their great piece of work, without which I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to create this theme.</p>
<p>I hope this theme won&rsquo;t be widely known or used because I&rsquo;m currently using it for my own website&hellip;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> but I&rsquo;m all for open source, so <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-paged">here you go</a>! If you decide to use this theme, I encourage you to tweak the CSS to make your site look at least a little different.</p>

<p>When I was developing <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown">the <strong>pagedown</strong> package</a> in R.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Paged.js developers are more generous than me. They were quite happy to know that I created this Hugo theme, and were not concerned that other websites would use their website theme. Hat tip to them!&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
